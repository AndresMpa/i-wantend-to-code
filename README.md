# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

This is a re implementation from the classic rock, paper, scissors; I got
the assets from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH)
and this project is a vanilla JS implementation, check the [scr/util](./src/util) to see
the logic behind it.

## What is this?

This is an interactive game that keeps your score even when you leave the page!!,
it means that you can leave the game in any moment; it doesn't matter, every time
you get back It will show you your fails keeping what you did, so you can lose as
much as you can...
