# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Spock, Lizard

This is a re implementation from the classic rock, paper, scissors; I got
the assents from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rock-paper-scissors-game-pTgwgvgH)
and this project is a vanilla JS implementation, check the scr/util to see
the logic behind it

# Check its deploy

This is also my first deploy to netlify and I love it <3
